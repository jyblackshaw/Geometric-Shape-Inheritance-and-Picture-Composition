# Geometric Shape Inheritance and Picture Composition
 
# Geometric Shape Project

This project showcases my proficiency in C++ programming, specifically focusing on class inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management. It demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming, emphasizing class hierarchies and virtual functions to create a modular, reusable, and extensible framework.

## Project Overview

The Geometric Shape Project involves creating a class hierarchy of 2D geometric shapes. It utilizes concepts of class inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management to build a framework where various shapes such as circles, rectangles, triangles, and squares can be manipulated and displayed.

## Key Objectives

- Implementing class inheritance and polymorphism in C++
- Utilizing virtual functions for achieving polymorphism
- Demonstrating effective memory management
- Displaying understanding of object-oriented design principles

## Technical Details

- **Base Class**: `Shape` - An abstract base class representing a generic geometric shape.
- **Derived Classes**: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, `Square` - Concrete classes extending `Shape` with specific geometric properties.
- **Auxiliary Class**: `Picture` - A class managing a collection of shapes and providing functionality to manipulate and display them.

## Project Structure

- `shape.hpp`, `shape.cpp`: Define the abstract base class `Shape`.
- `circle.hpp`, `circle.cpp`: Implement the `Circle` class.
- `rectangle.hpp`, `rectangle.cpp`: Implement the `Rectangle` class.
- `triangle.hpp`, `triangle.cpp`: Implement the `Triangle` class.
- `square.hpp`, `square.cpp`: Implement the `Square` class.
- `picture.hpp`, `picture.cpp`: Define and implement the `Picture` class.
- `standard_main.cpp`: Main program to demonstrate the functionality of the classes.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source files using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to see the demonstration of geometric shapes and their properties.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed to showcase proficiency in C++ programming, focusing on object-oriented design, class inheritance, and polymorphism.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different shapes, and gain insights into the implementation of class hierarchies and polymorphism in C++.
